Mysql Docker container
=========================

No complex boot script in this image!
If you want to initialize your date, just extends it!
This image contains a Mysql installation... so it start a Mysql daemon, as simple as possible!

```
FROM arcamael/mysql:0.2

RUN mysqld & while [ ! -e /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock ]; do sleep 1s; done && mysql -u root mysql -e "\
  UPDATE user SET password = PASSWORD('UNSECURED'); \
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'UNSECURED' WITH GRANT OPTION; \
"
VOLUME ["/var/lib/mysql"]
```

Volume are declared after you extend the base image. This way, volume is already ready when you start your container.
Need to save your data? Just use a data container.

```
docker build -t <your_extended_image> <path>
docker run --name myDataVolume <your_extended_image> echo Just initialize your volume
docker run -d --volumes-from myDataVolume <your_extended_image>
```
